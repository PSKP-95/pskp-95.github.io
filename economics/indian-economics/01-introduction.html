<h2 id="economics-the-discipline"><a class="header" href="#economics-the-discipline">Economics: The Discipline</a></h2>
<p>economics is the study of how societies use <strong>scarce resources</strong> to produce valuable commodities and distribute them among different people.</p>
<p>Economics studies how individuals, firms, governments, and other organisations within our society make choices and how these choices determine a society’s use of its resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we need to make some choices before we utilise the scarce resources by prioritising some of our needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-working-definition"><a class="header" href="#a-working-definition">A Working Definition</a></h3>
<p>Economics studies the economic activities of mankind. Similarly, political, social and administrative activities of mankind are studied under Political Science, Sociology and Public Administration, respectively. That is why these disciplines are broadly categorised as <strong>humanities</strong> as all of them study human activities.</p>
<p>The activities which involve profit, loss, livelihood, occupation, wage, employment, etc., are economic activities. Economics studies all these activities.</p>
<h3 id="economics-and-economy"><a class="header" href="#economics-and-economy">Economics and Economy</a></h3>
<p>Economics will come out with theories of market, employment, etc., and an economy is the real picture of the things which emerges after the application of those theories.</p>
<p>many countries selecting the same remedy and tools to fight the same problems might have similar or dissimilar results during a given period. At the same time, two economies selecting different tools to solve the same economic problems might experience the same results or completely different results.</p>
<p>The level and quality of natural resources, the quantity and quality of human resources, the socio-political milieu, the historical background, the psychic make of the human resource, etc., are some of the factors which individually as well as collectively impact an economy while carrying out economic activities</p>
<h3 id="distribution-network-models"><a class="header" href="#distribution-network-models">Distribution Network Models</a></h3>
<p><img src="./images/distribution-network-models.png" alt="Distribution Network Models" /></p>
<p>We have 3 types of models</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State</strong>: In the first type of distribution system, the state (i.e., the government) takes the sole responsibility of supplying goods and services required by the population with no payments being done by the consumer—the former Soviet Union and Communist China being the best examples.</li>
<li><strong>Market</strong>: In this system, goods and services are made available in the market and on the basis of their demand and supply, their prices are determined in the open market and finally they get distributed to the population.</li>
<li><strong>State-market mix</strong>: This distribution system has certain goods and services which might be made available to the population freely or at the subsidised prices by the state and some might be supplied by the market for which consumers need to pay.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-economy"><a class="header" href="#types-of-economy">Types of Economy</a></h3>
<p><img src="./images/type-of-economies.png" alt="Types of Economy" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Capitalistic Economy:</strong> The decisions of what to produce, how much to produce and at what price to sell are taken by the market, by the private enterprises in this system, with the state having no economic role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State Economy:</strong> socialistic economy emphasised collective ownership of the means of production (property and assets), it also ascribed a large role to the state in running the economy, while communist economy, on the other hand, advocated state ownership of all properties including labour with absolute power to state in running the economy. Here we see two versions of the state economy—in erstwhile USSR known as the socialist economy and in pre-1985 China as the communist economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mixed Economy:</strong> The impact of the great depression (1929) spread from the USA to other economies of Western Europe escalating large scale unemployment, downfall in demand and economic activities and lockouts in industrial enterprises. English economist at Cambridge University, John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) questioned the very principles of <strong>‘laissez-faire’</strong> and the nature of the <strong>‘invisible hand’</strong>(Wealth of Nation). He even opined that the invisible hand brings equilibirium to the economy but by ‘strangulating the poor’. He suggested that prices and wages are not flexible enough to provide employment to all. It means there will be some people unemployed when the economy will be at its full potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Laissez-faire</strong> is an economic system in which transactions between private parties are absent of any form of economic interventionism such as regulation and subsidies. As a system of thought, laissez-faire rests on the axioms that the individual is the basic unit in society and has a natural right to freedom; that the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system; and that corporations are creatures of the state and therefore the citizens must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian spontaneous order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the economy out of the depression, Keynes suggested an increase in government expenditures, discretionary fiscal policy (fiscal deficit, lower interest rates, cheap money supply, etc.) to boost the demand of goods and services as this was the reason behind the depression.</p>
<p>In the capitalist economies of the time, all the basic goods and services were part of the market mechanism, i.e., being produced and supplied by the private sector. It meant that almost everything the people required was supplied by the private enterprises via the market which was ultimately an undimensional movement of money and wealth (from the mass of people to the few who controlled the production and supply chain) and the masses were going through the process of pauperisation every day, thereby weakening their purchasing power. In the end, it affected overall demand and culminated in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>As a follow up to the Keynesian advices, governments of the time started producing and supplying some basic goods and services which are known as <strong>‘public goods’</strong>. These goods basically intended to guarantee minimum level of nutrition to all, healthcare, sanitation, education, social security, etc. The expenditure on public goods were incurred on the public exchequer even if it required deficit financing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The concluding consensus emerged with the publication of the World Development Report (1999) titled Entering the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7936em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">1</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.7936em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">s</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">t</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> Century in which the WB said, <strong>“Governments play a vital role in development, but there is no simple set of rules that tells them what to do.”</strong> The World Bank went on to suggest that every country should determine the areas and the extent of the market and the state intervention, depending upon its own stage of economic development, socio-political and other historical factors.</p>
<p>In the process of organising the economy, some basic and important infrastructural economic responsibilities were taken up by the state/governments (centre and state) and rest of the economic activities were left to private enterprises, i.e., the market.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-the-state-in-a-economy"><a class="header" href="#role-of-the-state-in-a-economy">Role of the State in a Economy</a></h2>
<p>Possible roles for the state/government in an economy:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>As a regulator of the economic system</strong> (where the state takes important economic decisions, announces the required kind of economic policies, takes the sole responsibility to get them implemented, and controlling and punishing those who don’t oblige to those economic decisions).</li>
<li><strong>As a producer and/or supplier of ‘private goods and services’</strong> (these include all those goods and services which constitute the part of market and which will be distributed among the needy according to the principles of market mechanism. Here the state earns profit as a private enterprise).</li>
<li><strong>As a producer and/or supplier of ‘public goods’ or ‘social goods’</strong> (these include goods and services which look essential from the perspective of social justice and well-being for the people. like ducation, healthcare, sanitation, drinking water, nutrition, caring for the differently abled and old, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The economy which selected both the roles (2 and 3) for the state under monopoly we called them the state. socialist economy at least the labour was not owned and exploited by the state unlike the other—the communist economy where labour used to be under complete state control.</p>
<p>The economic system which left both the roles (2 and 3) as the sole responsibilities of the private sector was called the capitalistic economic system.</p>
<p>Mixed economies had at least kept one economic role fixed for the state (i.e., 3), of supplying public goods to the needy people.</p>
<p><strong>Compulsory roles for the state in economy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>As  a regulator of  the  economic  system because If   the   regulation   and   control   of   an economy  is  left  to  private  individuals or  groups  (i.e., firms)  they  will  be  using the  regulatory  powers  to  maximise  their profits  and  returns  at  the  cost  of  others.</li>
<li>The   responsibility   of   producing   and supplying   the   social/public   goods   to the  needy  cannot  be  left  to  the  private sector as this is a loss-making exercise. It means, the state will have to take the sole responsibility or may need to expand its role  in  such  areas—as  we  see  it  in  post-reform India.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What should be left for market?</strong></p>
<p>The   responsibility   of   producing   and distributing  private  goods  to  the  people could  be  well  handled  by  the  private sector as this is a profit-fetching area. As the private sector became capable, in some countries this responsibility was given  up  by  the  state  in  favour  of  the private sector and better development has been possible in those economies. In this sense, India delayed this process while in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea allowed entry of the private sector much earlier.</p>

<p>Basically,   the   WB   study,   the East   Asian Miracle  (1993),  recognises  the  above-given  shift of one kind of mixed economy to another kind of mixed  economy—in  the  cases  of  the  Malaysian, Thai and South Korean economies—taking place since the mid-1960s. Experts believe that this shift could not take place in time in India. And once it started (1991–92) it was too late and this choice was not voluntary but obligatory.</p>

<p>If the value of the domestic currency falls following market mechanism in comparison to a foreign currency, it is a situation of ‘depreciation’ in the domestic currency, calculated in terms of loss in value of the domestic currency.</p>

<h4 id="cost"><a class="header" href="#cost">Cost</a></h4>
<p>Income of an economy, i.e., value of its total produced goods and services may be calculated at either the ‘factor cost’ or the ‘market cost’.</p>
<p><strong>Factor cost</strong> is the ‘input cost’ the producer has to incur in  the  process  of  producing  something (such  as  cost  of  capital,  i.e.,  interest  on loans, raw materials, labour, rent, power, etc.). This is also termed as ‘factory price’or ‘production cost/price’.</p>
<p><strong>market cost</strong> is  derived  after  adding  the  indirect  taxes to the factor cost of the product, it means the  cost  at  which  the  goods  reach  the market,  i.e.,  showrooms  (these  are  the cenvat/central excise and the CST which are  paid  by  the  producers  to  the  central government in India).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>India  officially  used  to  calculate  its national  income  at factor  cost  (though the  data  at market  cost was  also  released Since January 2015, the CSO has  switched  over  to  calculating  it  at market price (i.e., market cost).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the GST  has  been  implemented  it  will  be easier  for  India  to  calculate  its  national income at market price.</p>
<h4 id="price"><a class="header" href="#price">Price</a></h4>
<p>Income can be derived at two prices, constant  and  current. The  difference  in the  constant  and  current  prices  is  only that  of  the impact  of  inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is  considered  stand  still  at  a  year  of  the past  (this  year  of  the  past  is  also  known as  the <strong>‘base  year’</strong>)  in  the  case  of  the <strong>constant price</strong>, while in the <strong>current price</strong>, present  day  inflation  is  added.  Current price  is,  basically,  the  maximum  retail price (MRP) which we see printed on the goods selling in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As  per  the  new  guidelines  the base  year  in India has been revised from 2004–05 to 2011–12 (January 2015)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>India calculates its national income at constant prices —so is the situation among other developing   economies,   while   the   developed nations calculate it at the current prices.</p>
<p>Basically,  inflation  has  been  a  challenging  aspect of policymaking in India because of its level (i.e., range  in  which  it  dwindles)  and  stability  (how stable  it  has  been)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>nominal  income</strong>: The  wage  someone  gets  in  hand  per  day  or  per month.</li>
<li><strong>real  income</strong>: this  is nominal  income  minus  the  present  day  rate  of inflation—adjusted in percentage form.</li>
<li><strong>disposable  income</strong>: the  net  part of  wage  one  is  free  to  use  which  is  derived  after deducting the direct taxes from the real/nominal income, depending upon the need of data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="taxes-and-national-income"><a class="header" href="#taxes-and-national-income">Taxes and National Income</a></h3>
<p>While   accounting/calculating   national   income the  taxes,  direct  and  indirect,  collected  by  the government,  needs  to  be  considered.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Taxes:</strong> individual income   tax,   corporate   income   tax,   i.e.,   the corporate  tax,  divident  tax,  interest  tax,  etc.)</p>
<p>There is no need of adjustment whether the national income is accounted at factor cost or market cost. This is so because at both the ‘costs’ they  have  to  be  the  same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indirect Taxes:</strong> cenvat, customs, central sales tax, sales tax/vat, state excise, etc.</p>
<p>If  the  national  income  is calculated  at  factor  cost  then  the  corpus  of  the total indirect taxes needs to be deducted from it. This  is  because,  indirect  taxes  have  been  added twice: once at the point of the people/group who pay these taxes from their disposable income while purchasing things from the market, and again at the  point  of  the  governments  (as  their  income receipts)</p>
<p>Collection/source  of  indirect  taxes  are the ‘disposable  income’  (which  individuals  and companies have with them after paying their direct taxes—from  which  they  do  any  purchasing  and finally, the indirect taxes reach the government)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>National Income at Factor Cost = NNP at Market price - Indirect taxes</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="subsidies-and-national-income"><a class="header" href="#subsidies-and-national-income">Subsidies and National Income</a></h3>
<p>Subsidies which are forwarded by the governments need to be  adjusted  while  calculating  national  income. They are added to the national income at market cost,  in  the  case  of  India.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>National Income at Factor Cost = NNP at Market price - Subsidies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the national income is derived at the market cost and governments forward no subsidies there is  no  need  of  adjustments  for  the  subsidies but after all there is not a single economy in the world today which does not forward subsidies in one or the other form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>National Income at Factor Cost = NNP at Market price - Indirect taxes + Subsidies</p>

<p>The relationship between GVA at factor cost, GVA at basic prices, and GDP (at market prices) is given below:</p>
<p><strong>GVA  at  basic  prices</strong>  =  CE  +  OS/MI  + CFC + production taxes less production subsidies.</p>
<p><strong>GVA  at  factor  cost</strong>  =  GVA  at  basic prices – production taxes less production subsidies.</p>
<p><strong>GDP</strong>  =  GVA  at  basic  prices  +  product taxes – product subsidies.</p>

<li><strong>CE</strong> : compensation of employees;</li>
<li><strong>OS</strong>:    operating    surplus;</li>
<li><strong>MI</strong>:    mixed income;</li>
<li><strong>CFC</strong>: consumption of fixed capital  (i.e.,  depriciation)</li>
<li><strong>Production taxes</strong>:  land revenues, stamps and registration fees and tax on profession.</li>
<li><strong>production subsidies</strong> are subsidies to  Railways,  input  subsidies  to  farmers, subsidies  to  village  and  small  industries, administrative  subsidies  to  corporations or  cooperatives,  etc.
